      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <p>
        We don't expect most engineers to know the answers to all of these
        questions, so don't worry if you're unsure of a few of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each question is timed and can only be answered once.<br />Changing
        browser tab or opening other windows will invalidate the question.<br />This
        exam will take approx. 0-5 minutes.
